## Delta Lake Example Notebook

Delta Lake stores data in the open-source Apache Parquet file format but enhances it with a transaction log. This transaction log provides features like ACID transactions, schema enforcement, and time travel, making Delta Lake a more reliable and performant storage solution compared to using Parquet files alone.

### Here's a notebook with ready-to-use code examples.

* This notebook includes:

* Creating a Delta table

* Reading and writing

* Updating with DeltaTable

* Time travel example

You can open it in Jupyter or import it into Databricks and run it directly.
